2. Register your account when in-game by typing /register password

3. Now stop the server, by closing the server console.

4. Add your username and level to the admin XML file.

File Path: Essentials-main\resources\Essentials\Data\VC\Players.xml

<Root>
	<Player name="Mex" level="10" />
</Root>
```

Note: Choose the applicable game folder in the file path. (Either III, VC, SA.)<br/>
Note: Change the username Mex to your username which you chose in the GTAC launcher.

5. The server is now ready to start (again), and your admin account should now be setup.
